It offers a strong focus on acne and surface bacteria through its specific 415nm Blue light mode.",

          <p>
            LED face masks have exploded in {market.titleCountry}, but the
            market is confusing. Prices range from{" "}
            <strong>{market.priceRange}</strong>, and many brands make almost
            identical claims about collagen, acne, redness, and anti-ageing
            results.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we tested <strong>18 of the most popular LED masks</strong> over{" "}
            <strong>200+ hours</strong>, comparing wavelengths, light coverage,
            comfort, eye safety, neck treatment, ease of use, reviews, price,
            and guarantees.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest finding was simple: a higher price did not always mean
            better results. The best masks used the right wavelengths, gave even
            face and neck coverage, and were easy enough to use consistently at
            home.
