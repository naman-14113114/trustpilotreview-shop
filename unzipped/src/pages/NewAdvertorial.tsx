      "Our top pick is the Buudy 7 Colour LED Mask, a medical-grade device that outperforms the competition with a 7-colour spectrum plus 830nm near-infrared. While most brands focus only on basic red light, Buudy uses targeted wavelengths to support everything from deep wrinkles and acne to inflammation, uneven tone, and overall skin recovery. This Health Canada Approved technology (with CE, FCC, and ROHS certifications) ensures professional-grade results for all skin types.",
      "A major advantage is the built-in neck coverage, a vital feature often missing from more expensive models. This allows you to treat \"turkey neck\" and sagging skin simultaneously. The cordless, rechargeable design features \"Tap Technology\" and Buudy AI guided sessions, making it simple to choose the right routine for your skin goals.",
      "Trusted by over 16,000 customers with a 4.9-star rating, this mask delivers visible improvements in as few as ten uses.

The exact wavelengths are 633nm red, 415nm blue, 525nm green, 490nm cyan, 590nm yellow, 390nm purple, 510nm white, and 830nm near-infrared for deeper support.",

      "The CurrentBody LED Mask stands out as a premier selection in our evaluation, solidifying its reputation as a global leader in non-invasive skincare technology. Engineered with a sophisticated blend of red and near-infrared light, this device is clinically projected to reduce wrinkles by 24% in just four weeks.",

      "Very Limited Treatment Modes: This is an anti-aging-only device. It only offers 3 red/near-infrared wavelengths and completely lacks the 7-color versatility of the Buudy mask. It cannot be used to target acne (Blue light), dark spots (Green light), or redness (Yellow light).",
      "Not a Complete Solution: Because it only targets one concern (aging), it is not a comprehensive solution for total skin health like a multi-color mask.",
      "Costly Money-Back Guarantee: The 60-day money-back guarantee is not 100% free. Customers are charged a 10% restocking fee to return it, which would be £40 on a £400 mask.",

      "The Shark CryoGlow LED Face Mask has quickly made headlines and won prestigious beauty awards since its launch. From a trusted brand known for high-tech innovation, Shark offers the first LED mask featuring integrated under-eye cooling technology, making it a unique 2-in-1 solution for facial care.",
      "Endorsed by leading beauty editors at Oprah Daily and Women's Health, this mask offers three \"chill\" levels and four distinct treatment modes, including Better Ageing and Blemish Repair. These advanced settings ensure a quick and efficient therapy session in as little as 6 to 8 minutes, utilizing proven wavelengths like Red (630nm) and Blue (415nm) light.",
      "In our experience, a single daily session is all that is required to see noticeable improvements in skin clarity and tone. The independent clinical studies and dermatologist-backed technology specifically excel at brightening the under-eye area, with users reporting that the cooling pads visibly reduce puffiness and refresh the complexion after just one use."

      "Strong Brand & Reviews: Shark is a well-known, trusted brand, and the mask has a high 4.6-star rating from over 500 reviews.",

    cons: [
      "Extremely High Price: At £299.99, it is more than double the price of the Buudy mask (£179) for what is arguably less technology.",

      "Severely Limited Light Modes: The mask is heavily focused on its cooling gimmick and offers very few light options. It is missing 5 of the 7 wavelengths (Green, Yellow, Cyan, Purple, White) that the Buudy mask has for targeting dark spots, skin balancing, and reducing swelling.",
      "Unspecified LED Count: A major red flag. The page does not state the number of LEDs, suggesting the count is low. A lower LED count (compared to Buudy's 192 high-density LEDs) means less power and less even skin coverage.",
      "Very Heavy & Rigid: At 675g, this mask is exceptionally heavy. This, combined with a rigid (non-silicone) design, can make it uncomfortable to wear and may not fit all face shapes well.",
      "Not a Complete Solution: It's a 2-in-1 device that compromises on the LED therapy. A customer wanting to treat hyperpigmentation (Green light) or balance skin texture (Yellow light) would get no benefit from this mask."

Known for its ultra-fast 3-minute treatment time, it is highly sought after by those with busy schedules. It offers a strong focus on acne and surface bacteria through its specific 415nm Blue light mode.",
      "However, the staggering £455 price point makes it an incredibly expensive investment, especially given its limitations. With a rigid, unyielding hard plastic shell, many users report significant discomfort on the bridge of the nose and uneven light coverage across different bone structures.",
      "Crucially, at this premium price, it entirely lacks neck and chest coverage. While it does provide convenience, the 162 LEDs offer a lower density of light compared to modern high-output models, and it completely misses out on 5 vital therapeutic color spectrums needed for comprehensive facial health, making it a pricey option compared to more feature-rich alternatives."

      "Lower LED Density: Containing only 162 LEDs, it has a lower light density than modern high-output models, resulting in larger gaps between light points on the skin.",
      "Rigid, Uncomfortable Fit: The hard plastic shell does not flex. Users with varying bone structures frequently report significant discomfort on the bridge of the nose and uneven light coverage, a stark contrast to the comfort of soft, molding silicone.",
      "Severely Limited Color Spectrum: It offers only 3 modes (Red, Blue, and Combo). It completely misses out on Green (pigmentation), Yellow (redness), Cyan, Purple, and White light therapies that come standard with Buudy.",
      "Short Battery Life: The internal battery is kept small to reduce the mask's weight, meaning it requires much more frequent charging than devices utilizing external power banks.",
      "Fragile Build: Rigid plastic masks are inherently prone to cracking or breaking if accidentally dropped, unlike durable, travel-friendly silicone options.",

          <p>LED face masks have exploded in the UK, but the market is confusing. Prices range from <strong>£100 to £600+</strong>, and many brands make almost identical claims about collagen, acne, redness, and anti-ageing results.</p>
          <p>So we tested <strong>18 of the most popular LED masks</strong> over <strong>200+ hours</strong>, comparing wavelengths, light coverage, comfort, eye safety, neck treatment, ease of use, reviews, price, and guarantees.</p>
          <p>The biggest finding was simple: a higher price did not always mean better results. The best masks used the right wavelengths, gave even face and neck coverage, and were easy enough to use consistently at home.</p>
          <p>Below, we rank the LED masks that actually stood out, including the one we believe offers the strongest balance of results, safety, comfort, and value for UK buyers.</p>
